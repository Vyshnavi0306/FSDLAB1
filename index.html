                     <h1>HAPPINESS DEFINITION</h1>
    <p>Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many different definitions, it is often described as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction. </p>

             <h1>HAPPINESS</h1>
             <P>Happiness is something that people seek to find, yet what defines happiness can vary from one person to the next. When most people talk about the true meaning of happiness, they might be talking about how they feel in the present moment or referring to a more general sense of how they feel about life overall. </P>

             <h1>Valuing the Wrong Things</h1>
             <P>Money may not be able to buy happiness, but there is research that spending money on things like experiences can make you happier than spending it on material possessions. 

              One study, for example, found that spending money on things that buy time—such as spending money on time-saving services—can increase happiness and life satisfaction.15﻿
              
              Rather than overvaluing things such as money, status, or material possessions, pursuing goals that result in more free time or enjoyable experiences may have a higher happiness reward.</P>

                     <h1>Not Seeking Social Support</h1>
                     <p>Hedonia and eudemonia are more commonly known today in psychology as pleasure and meaning, respectively. More recently, psychologists have suggested the addition of the third component that relates to engagement. These are feelings of commitment and participation in different areas of life.

                      Research suggests that happy people tend to rank pretty high on eudaimonic life satisfaction and better than average on their hedonic life satisfaction.2

             <h1>Enjoy the Moment</h1>
             <P>Studies have found that people tend to over earn—they become so focused on accumulating things that they lose track of actually enjoying what they are doing.5﻿

              So, rather than falling into the trap of mindlessly accumulating to the detriment of your own happiness, focus on practicing gratitude for the things you have and enjoying the process as you go.  </P>

             <h1>How to Be a Happier Person</h1>
<P>So while you might not be able to control what your “base level” of happiness is, there are things that you can do to make your life happier and more fulfilling. Even the happiest of individuals can feel down from time to time and happiness is something that all people need to consciously pursue.
